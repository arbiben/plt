TUESDAY TODO:
- testing our new operations: neg tests and anything we didn't do yet
- How do we call a function on an array?
- testing script and writing all the tests
- Should we include comments in the pretty printing?
- Should we include the type of variables inside the function params in printing? for example -> f(int a) now prints f(a). should we include int?


### Here: how to compile and execute our compiler

### Here: how to run our test script

### Here: Syntax still left to add to our language
	- Aliasing file/direc/string to be recognized as ID's of a certain struct type
	- Casting from one type to another- we may need to create specific functions for that
	- Not have required ordering to variables- functions - structs 
	- Using structs as types: for example "bigint i?"	
	- Declaraing and initializing variables outside of functions
	- Including the empty character
