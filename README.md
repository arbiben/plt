### Here: how to compile and execute our compiler

### Here: how to run our test script

### Here: Syntax still left to add to our language
	- Aliasing file/direc/string to be recognized as ID's of a certain struct type
	- Casting from one type to another- we may need to create specific functions for that
	- Not have required ordering to variables- functions - structs 
	- Using structs as types: for example "bigint i?"	
	- Declaraing and initializing variables outside of functions
	- Including the empty character in possible characters
	- Calling a function on an array implicitly with dot
	- Calling the whole program with a main()
