This is our GitHub repo for the PLT project, Spring 2019

TUESDAY TODO:
- testing our new operations: extract, index, arraybuild, etc
- How do we call a function on an array?
- testing script and writing all the tests
- using structs as types?


### Here: how to compile and execute our compiler

### Here: how to run our test script

### Here: Syntax still left to add to our language
	- Aliasing file/direc/string to be recognized as ID's of a certain struct type
	- Casting from one type to another- we may need to create specific functions for that
	- Not have required ordering to variables- functions - structs
