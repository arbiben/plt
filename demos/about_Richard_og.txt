Richard Townsend is a 5th year PhD student at Columbia University studying
Programming Languages and Compilers under Stephen A. Edwards and Martha A.
Kim;
His research focuses on the use of functional languages and high-level
optimizations to translate recursive algorithms with irregular memory access
patterns into efficient hardware designs;
This work revolves around his research group's current project: an optimizing Haskell-to-SystemVerilog
compiler.
