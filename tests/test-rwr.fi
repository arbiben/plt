$ this test file tests writing a string to a non-existing file, then reading a string from an existing text file, then writing this string to two different files. One in which the string in converted to lower case and one in which it is converted to upper-case. then it prints the contents of all files$
$ Does not exist in MicroC $
$ Expects the follwing output: 
  
Original File: ThiS IS A StrinG
Lower Case File: this is a string
Upper Case File: THIS IS A STRING
